## 1. Introduction

RedefineMe Ltd ("RedefineMe", "we", "us", or "our") operates the RedefineMe mobile application ("the App"), available on Android. RedefineMe is a university society event aggregator that helps students at UK universities discover events run by their societies.

This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your rights under UK data protection law (UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018).

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 2. Information We Collect

### (a) Information you provide to us

When you create an account, we collect:

| Data | Why we ask for it |
|---|---|
| Email address | To create and identify your account |
| Full name | To personalise your experience |
| University | To show you events relevant to your institution |
| Course and year of study | To surface more relevant event recommendations |

When you use the App, we also store:

- **RSVP / attending status** — events you indicate you are attending
- **Event shares** — events you share via the App's share feature

### (b) Information collected automatically

When you use the App, Supabase (our backend provider) issues and stores a **session authentication token** to keep you signed in. This token is stored securely on your device and transmitted only to Supabase servers to verify your identity. We do not log IP addresses beyond what Supabase retains for security and abuse prevention purposes in the normal course of operating its service.

### (c) Information we do NOT collect

To be clear about the limits of our data collection:

- We do **not** collect your device's GPS location or coarse network location
- We do **not** collect device identifiers (IDFA, Android Advertising ID, IMEI, etc.)
- We do **not** collect push notification tokens (push notifications are not yet implemented)
- We do **not** collect any financial or payment information
- We do **not** read, store, or process the content of any messages or communications
- We do **not** use advertising SDKs or analytics SDKs in the App

We do not sell your personal data. We do not share your data with advertising networks or data brokers.

We share data only with the following parties, solely to operate the App:

**Supabase Inc.**
Our database and authentication provider. Supabase acts as a data processor on our behalf under a Data Processing Agreement. All data is stored in Supabase's **eu-central-1** region (Frankfurt, Germany), within the EU. Supabase's privacy policy is available at [supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

**Expo / Expo Application Services (EAS)**

**Law enforcement or regulatory authorities**
We may disclose personal data where required to do so by law, court order, or in response to a legitimate request from a law enforcement or regulatory authority.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored on Supabase infrastructure located in **Frankfurt, Germany (eu-central-1)**. This region is within the EU and subject to EU data protection standards, which are deemed adequate under UK GDPR.

We take the following measures to protect your data:

- All data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted in transit using TLS
- Data is encrypted at rest on Supabase infrastructure
- Access to the database is restricted by role-based access controls
- Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth, which follows industry-standard security practices

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If you become aware of any security concern related to your account, please contact us at admin@redefine-me.com immediately.

## 6. Data Retention

**Active accounts:** We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active and you continue to use the App.

**Deleted accounts:** When you delete your account (via the in-app account deletion feature), your personal data is marked for deletion and permanently purged from our systems within **30 days**. This window allows us to recover from accidental deletions and to complete any backup rotation cycles.

After 30 days, no personally identifiable information relating to your account is retained.

## 8. Children's Policy

The App is intended for use by university students aged **18 and over**.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If you believe a child under 18 has provided us with personal data, please contact us at admin@redefine-me.com and we will delete that data promptly.

---

## 9. Third-Party Links

Event listings in the App may include links to external websites for event registration or further information (for example, a society's website or a ticketing platform). These links are provided for convenience and are not operated by RedefineMe.

We have no control over, and accept no responsibility for, the privacy practices or content of any third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of any external site you visit.

---

## 10. Sponsored and Promoted Content

Some events displayed in the App may be sponsored or promoted by university societies or other organisations. Where this is the case, the event will be clearly labelled.

At this stage, we do not collect any personal data from the societies or organisations whose events are promoted. No targeting of users based on personal data is used for sponsored content decisions.

If our approach to sponsored content changes in a way that involves new data processing, this policy will be updated accordingly.

---

## 11. Push Notifications

Push notifications are **not currently implemented** in the App. We do not collect push notification tokens at this time.

If we introduce push notifications in the future, we will request your explicit permission before sending any notifications, and this Privacy Policy will be updated to describe how notification preferences and tokens are handled.

---

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will notify you by:

- Displaying a notice within the App on your next login, or
- Sending a notification to the email address associated with your account

The "Effective date" at the top of this page will always reflect when the policy was last updated. Continued use of the App after a policy update constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.

We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
